We have three stages: Liftoff, Apogee and Landing

Liftoff: we need to look for a threshold crossing and make sure that the acceleration is stays above a certain value for a certain amount of time

Apogee: near zero or negative acceleration after the liftoff, and before the descent. Also, there might be a stabilization or decrease of the barometer


Landing: a sudden deceleration of the rocket

Liftoff threshold: 1.5
Apogee threshold: -0.5
Landing threshold: 1.5
